## Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning



## Introduction

â€‹		[\[ Li et al. (2023)\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07067) approached in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem with a statistical perspective, presented generalization bounds for MTL where the model is trained with t tasks each mapped to a sequence containing n examples, describes when the Transformer/Attention can prove to obey stability conditions, and provides empirical validation. Finally, Mathematical proof that Transformer can indeed achieve near optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. (input, output) and dynamic data.
